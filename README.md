## Description:

This application allows you to search for books on google, and then save them in a convenient booklist for later use.

## Usage:

Just type in the corresponding search terms, and the website will return any books related to your search. 

If you wish to save any books for later viewing, simply create an account by signing up, and you can save a personal booklist for yourself!

## Issues:

The search function may pull up seemingly incomplete results that you cannot save to your own booklist. If that happens, do a more thorough search and attempt to save a book that has a more complete set of results.
